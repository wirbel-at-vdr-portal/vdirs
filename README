Description: This plugin manages multiple disks inside vdr.


At the root file system a folder /video should exist, where all supplementary
files are located. Usually, a few GB should be enough, even for large video
collections.

The video files are located on other file systems, mounted on
/mnt/video0 ..
/mnt/videoN

The plugin creates symlinks from /video/<NAME_OF_RECORDING>/<DATE>/*.ts to
files the actual files on /mnt/videoX/.. in a flat directory structure
(no sub dirs). So, the large video files are now on a different volume.

Example:

ls -l /video/Zuhause_ist_der_Zauber_los/2013-01-04.20.12.3-0.rec/

00001.ts -> /mnt/video1/Zuhause_ist_der_Zauber_los~2013-01-04_20_12_3-0~00001.ts
index
resume






For using this plugin, all existing video files need to be imported into this
scheme. For this a shell script exists, see folder scripts.
IMPORTANT: Before importing, the disk sequence, see below, needs to be set.


The plugin also takes care of disk space on the mounted disks, you can adjust
the default storage space by setting vdirs.DiskSeq in vdrs setup.conf.

vdirs.DiskSeq = 0i

For each disk, there is a character, so '0i' is a setup for two disks. Every
recording with it's name beginning with '0' to 'j' goes to the first disk, every
recording with 'i' and up to 'z' goes to the second disk.
     disk0 '0'..'h'
     disk1 'i'..'z'

This is the order of letters used: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

A setup with three disks could be for example '0do':
     disk0 '0'..'c'
     disk1 'd'..'n'
     disk2 'o'..'z'

Disk balancing is implemented, but not yet well tested - my disk are too large..
